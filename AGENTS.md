This file provides guidance to AI coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Toolbox is a full-stack Hoist application by Extremely Heavy Industries (XH) that serves as the
primary demo, test, and reference implementation for the **Hoist UI framework**. It includes
desktop, mobile, and admin apps plus several standalone example applications (contact, todo,
portfolio, news, recalls, filemanager).

Because Toolbox is the development and testing vehicle for Hoist itself, two framework plugins are
central to work in this repo:

- **`@xh/hoist`** (hoist-react) — the client-side React/MobX framework
- **`hoist-core`** — the server-side Grails/Spring Boot framework

Understanding these frameworks is essential to writing correct, idiomatic code in this application.

## Hoist Framework Documentation — READ THIS FIRST

### hoist-react (client-side)

Read the Architecture Primer below, then use the MCP tools for full documentation on any package.

#### Architecture Primer

Hoist applications are built around three artifact types:

| Artifact | Base Class | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|----------|------------|---------|-----------|
| **Component** | `hoistCmp.factory` | UI rendering (React) | Transient — mount/unmount with views |
| **Model** | `HoistModel` | Observable state + business logic | Varies — linked to component or standalone |
| **Service** | `HoistService` | App-wide data access + shared state | Singleton — lives for app lifetime |

**Element factories over JSX.** Hoist uses element factory functions, not JSX:
```typescript
// ✅ Hoist style
panel({title: 'Users', items: [grid(), button({text: 'Refresh'})]})

// ❌ Not used in Hoist
<Panel title="Users"><Grid /><Button text="Refresh" /></Panel>
```

**Components** are created with `hoistCmp.factory`. Each component declares its model relationship:
```typescript
export const userList = hoistCmp.factory({
    model: creates(UserListModel),  // Component creates and owns this model
    render({model}) {
        return panel({title: 'Users', item: grid()});
    }
});
```

**Model wiring — `creates()` vs `uses()`:**
- `creates(ModelClass)` — component instantiates, owns, and destroys the model on unmount.
- `uses(ModelClass)` — component receives model from a parent via context or explicit prop.

**Context-based model lookup** eliminates prop drilling. When a component `creates()` a model, that
model is published to React context. Child components using `uses(ModelClass)` automatically find
the nearest matching model in the ancestor tree. All public properties of ancestor models are
searched — so if `PanelModel` has a `gridModel: GridModel` property, a child `grid()` call
resolves it automatically. (Note: `@managed` is unrelated to lookup — it controls cleanup on
destroy. A property does not need `@managed` to be found via context lookup.)

When multiple models of the same type exist in context (e.g. two `GridModel` instances), pass the
model explicitly: `grid({model: model.leftGridModel})`.

**HoistModel** — the core state holder:
```typescript
class UserListModel extends HoistModel {
    @observable.ref users: User[] = [];
    @bindable selectedUserId: string = null;
    @managed detailModel = new UserDetailModel();

    constructor() {
        super();
        makeObservable(this);  // Required when class adds new observables
    }

    override async doLoadAsync(loadSpec: LoadSpec) {
        const users = await XH.fetchJson({url: 'api/users', loadSpec});
        runInAction(() => this.users = users);
    }
}
```

**Key decorators:**

| Decorator | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `@observable` / `@observable.ref` | MobX observable state |
| `@bindable` | Observable + auto-generated action-wrapped setter |
| `@managed` | Mark child object for automatic cleanup on `destroy()` |
| `@persist` | Sync property with a persistence provider (requires `persistWith`) |
| `@lookup(ModelClass)` | Inject ancestor model (linked models only, available after `onLinked`) |
| `@computed` | Cached derived value |
| `@action` | Mark method as state-modifying |

**`makeObservable(this)`** must be called in the constructor of any class that introduces new
`@observable`, `@bindable`, or `@computed` properties. The base class call does not cover subclass
decorators. Forgetting this is the most common Hoist bug.

**`doLoadAsync(loadSpec)`** — implement this template method to opt into managed data loading.
Call `model.loadAsync()` or `model.refreshAsync()` to trigger — never call `doLoadAsync` directly.
Linked models with `doLoadAsync` are loaded automatically on mount.

**HoistService** — singleton services installed during app init and accessed via `XH`:
```typescript
XH.tradeService.submitTradeAsync(trade);  // Custom service
XH.fetchJson({url: 'api/data'});          // FetchService alias
XH.getConf('featureFlag', false);         // ConfigService alias
XH.getPref('pageSize', 50);              // PrefService alias
```

**XH singleton** — the top-level API entry point. Provides service access, data fetching
(`fetchJson`, `postJson`), user interaction (`toast`, `confirm`, `prompt`, `handleException`),
navigation (`navigate`, `appendRoute`), and app state (`appState`, `darkTheme`).

**Critical pitfalls:**
1. **Forgetting `makeObservable(this)`** — observables silently won't react.
2. **Managing objects you don't own** — only `@managed` objects your class creates. Objects passed
   in from outside are owned by the provider.
3. **Mutating observables outside actions** — use `runInAction()`, `@action`, or `@bindable`.
4. **Calling `lookupModel()` too early** — only works during or after `onLinked()`.
5. **Calling `doLoadAsync()` directly** — use `loadAsync()` / `refreshAsync()` entry points.

#### MCP Tools

For full documentation beyond this primer, use the hoist-react MCP tools:

- **`hoist-search-docs`** — keyword search across all docs; use doc IDs from the table above
- **`hoist-search-symbols`** — search TypeScript symbols, classes, and API signatures
- **`hoist-list-docs`** — browse the complete documentation catalog
- **`hoist-get-symbol`** / **`hoist-get-members`** — detailed type info for specific classes

**Skipping the docs risks producing code that conflicts with established patterns or misses
built-in functionality.**

### hoist-core (server-side)

The hoist-core repository contains a growing `docs/` directory at its top level with important
documentation on server-side architecture, services, and conventions. Consult these docs — either
via the public GitHub repository at https://github.com/xh/hoist-core or a local sibling checkout
(`../hoist-core`) — for specific guidance on server-side work. A local checkout is common for XH
developers but is not required and may be out of date. **Prefer the GitHub repository as the
authoritative source unless asked not to or the context suggests the local version is more
relevant.** For topics not yet covered by docs, refer to the existing source code in `grails-app/`.

## MCP Servers

This project configures MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers in `.mcp.json` that provide additional
tools to AI coding agents. Servers must also be listed in `.claude/settings.json` under
`enabledMcpjsonServers` to be active.

### hoist-react (enabled by default)

A local Node.js process that exposes hoist-react framework documentation and symbol search. The
Architecture Primer above covers essential patterns inline; the MCP provides full documentation
for all 39 packages and concepts. No additional setup is required; it runs directly from installed
`node_modules`.

### github (opt-in)

A Docker-based server providing GitHub API tools (issues, PRs, code search, etc.) via the official
`github-mcp-server` image. This server is **not enabled by default**. To use it:

1. Install and start **Docker**
2. Set the **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** environment variable to a GitHub Personal Access Token
3. Add `"github"` to `enabledMcpjsonServers` in `.claude/settings.local.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "enabledMcpjsonServers": ["hoist-react", "github"]
   }
   ```

If Docker is not running or the token is not set when the server is enabled, Claude Code may show
errors on startup. Disable the server by removing `"github"` from your local settings if this
becomes disruptive.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React 18, MobX, AG Grid, Highcharts, `@xh/hoist` framework
- **Backend**: Grails 7 (Groovy/Spring Boot), `hoist-core` framework
- **Database**: MySQL (or H2 in-memory for quick local dev via `APP_TOOLBOX_USE_H2=true`)
- **Package Manager**: Yarn 1.22 (frontend), Gradle via wrapper (backend)

## Common Commands

### Frontend (run from `client-app/`)
```bash
yarn install              # Install dependencies
yarn start                # Dev server on port 3000
yarn build                # Production build
yarn lint                 # Run ESLint + Stylelint
yarn lint:code            # ESLint only
yarn lint:styles          # Stylelint only
yarn startWithHoist       # Dev server using local sibling hoist-react
```

### Backend (run from project root)
```bash
./gradlew bootRun     # Start Grails server on port 8080
./gradlew console     # Grails interactive console
```

### Local Development
Run both simultaneously:
- Terminal 1: `./gradlew bootRun`
- Terminal 2: `cd client-app && yarn start`

### Pre-commit Hooks
Husky runs automatically on commit: `lint-staged` (prettier + eslint on staged files) and conditionally the TypeScript compiler if TS/JS/package files are staged.

## Code Style

- **Prettier**: 100 char width, single quotes, no trailing commas, 4-space indent (JS/TS), 2-space (SCSS/JSON)
- **No bracket spacing**: `{foo}` not `{ foo }`
- **Arrow parens**: avoid when possible (`x => x` not `(x) => x`)
- **Semicolons**: always
- **Trailing commas**: none
- **Commit messages**: Do not hard-wrap lines in commit message bodies. Write each sentence or thought as a single unwrapped line and let the viewing tool handle display wrapping.

## Architecture

### Frontend (`client-app/src/`)
- **`apps/`** — Entry points for each app (app.ts, admin.ts, contact.ts, etc.). Each calls `XH.renderApp()`.
- **`desktop/`** — Main desktop app: `AppModel.ts` (state) + `AppComponent.tsx` (UI), organized into `tabs/` (home, forms, grids, charts, layout, panels, other, examples).
- **`mobile/`** — Mobile app variant.
- **`admin/`** — Admin console.
- **`examples/`** — Standalone example applications (contact, todo, portfolio, news, recalls, filemanager).
- **`core/`** — Shared services (`svc/`), auth (`AuthModel.ts`), column definitions.
- **`Bootstrap.ts`** — AG Grid & Highcharts license/module registration.

**Key pattern**: Apps follow Model + Component pairing. Models hold state (MobX observables), Components render UI. Services are singleton classes for data fetching and business logic. See the hoist-react docs (referenced above) for detailed coverage of this architecture.

### Backend (`grails-app/`)
- **`controllers/`** — REST controllers extending `BaseController` (from hoist-core). Package: `io.xh.toolbox.*`
- **`services/`** — Business logic extending `BaseService`. Support `CachedValue`, `clearCachesConfigs`.
- **`domain/`** — GORM domain classes.
- **`conf/`** — `application.groovy` and `runtime.groovy` configuration.
- **`init/`** — Bootstrap, security, logging setup.

### Instance Configuration
Environment variables loaded from `.env` file (copy `.env.template` to `.env`). Required: `APP_TOOLBOX_ENVIRONMENT`, `APP_TOOLBOX_DB_HOST`, `APP_TOOLBOX_DB_SCHEMA`, `APP_TOOLBOX_DB_USER`, `APP_TOOLBOX_DB_PASSWORD`.

## Changelog

Toolbox maintains a `CHANGELOG.md` that is parsed at build time by `changelog-parser` (via
hoist-dev-utils) and displayed in-app to users via Hoist's `ChangelogService`. Write entries for an
audience of developers and potential clients evaluating Hoist.

### Format

The file follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) structure:

```
# Changelog

## 9.0-SNAPSHOT - unreleased

### New Features

* Added Weather Dashboard example app backed by the OpenWeatherMap API.

### Libraries

* @xh/hoist 80.0.1
```

- **Version headings**: `## <version> - <date>` — no `v` prefix. Use `SNAPSHOT - unreleased` for
  the in-development version.
- **Recognized categories** (used for styling in the in-app dialog): `Breaking Changes`,
  `New Features`, `Bug Fixes`, `Technical`, `Libraries`.

### Critical: single-line bullets only

The changelog parser works **line-by-line**. Bullet points are only recognized when a line starts
with `*` or `-`. Continuation lines, wrapped text, and nested sub-bullets are **silently dropped**
from the parsed output.

**Every bullet MUST be a single line — no matter how long.** Do not wrap, indent continuation text,
or use nested sub-bullets. A 300-character single line is correct; a neatly wrapped two-line bullet
is broken.

```
// GOOD — single line, renders completely in-app
* Added Weather Dashboard example app — a full-stack weather dashboard backed by the OpenWeatherMap API, featuring a `DashCanvas` layout with multiple chart types.

// BAD — continuation line will be silently dropped
* Added Weather Dashboard example app — a full-stack weather dashboard backed by the OpenWeatherMap
  API, featuring a `DashCanvas` layout with multiple chart types.
```

### Style

- Use past tense ("Added", "Fixed", "Removed" — not "Add", "Fix", "Remove").
- Be concise but specific about what changed and why.
- Use backticks for API names, component names, and config keys (e.g. `ViewManager`, `useOAuth`).
