## Hoist React Documentation — READ BEFORE WRITING CODE

Before writing or modifying any client-side code, **consult the hoist-react documentation** via the
index at [`docs/hoist-react/README.md`](./docs/hoist-react/README.md). This is a symlink into the
`@xh/hoist` package — the docs are shipped with the library and are the authoritative reference for
how Hoist features work. **Read the docs index first, not raw source code.**
