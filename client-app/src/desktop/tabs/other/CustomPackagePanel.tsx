                When supporting multiple applications within an organization, it can be helpful to
                extract common components, services, styles, and utilities into a custom package
                for use across apps.
            </p>,
            <p>
                The minimal <code>@xh/package-template</code> project provides an example of such a
                project. The styled panel below is imported from that package.

            <p>
                Note that this package is referenced within Toolbox's
                own <code>client-app/webpack.config.js</code> to ensure its codebase is processed
                at build time in the same manner as the app codebase and Hoist React itself.
