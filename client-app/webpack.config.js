/**
 * Toolbox demonstrates the use of a custom JS package (@xh/package-template) that is transpiled
 * and processed alongside the app and hoist-react code. The use of such a package requires some
 * extra configuration entries here in webpack.config.js to instruct Webpack/Babel to process the
 * package JS/SASS. (Like hoist-react, this sample package is left unbundled/uncompiled when
 * published to npm so it can be processed in one shot and with the same tooling as the app.)
 *
 * Note that apps that do NOT make use of such a custom package do NOT need to set the
 * babelIncludePaths, babelExcludePaths, or resolveAliases keys used below.
